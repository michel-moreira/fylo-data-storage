## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- That project made me learn about semantic HTML5

- Working with flexible display using the flexbox properties, positioning elements on the screen.

- Working with external fonts (Google fonts) to improve a better custom apparence.

- Working with borders.

- To make a progress bar.

### Useful resources

- [Progress Bar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CldkblcJJTw&ab_channel=Rogers) - This video helped me how to make a progress bar, indeed, it was a challenge. I will use it going forward.
- [Chat Ballon](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/30134/bot%C3%B5es-pontudos-e-bal%C3%B5es-de-texto) - In this forum, people helped me create a different border and made me look at the subject with more creative ideas.
- [CSS Tool](https://cssgenerator.org/) - This site improves the way we manipulate some CSS properties, I recommend it to anyone who wants to speed up their work.
